## Experience

Setting up the page in the way I wanted was the most difficult part, alongside with just trying to come up with creative ideas. I was a bit confused on how
well the nav bar had to work and if every page needed one. I was able to get the whole thing done and I had a lot of fun doing it 

## Known issues or Bugs

None
